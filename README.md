Bolt is a utility mod for modpacks that adds numerous tweaks and miscelaneous features that are configurable.

Bolt is used by all Luna Pixel modpacks, and more. Simply add it to your modpack and run it once to generate the default configuration!

The original aim of Bolt is to minimize the amount of QoL and Tweak based mods in modpacks, allowing for more mods that actually add content - users prefer to download modpacks with about 200-350 mods, QoL and Tweak mods take up 15% of that, with a rough average of 30-50 mods being single mixins and little tweaks.

Currently, Bolt merges together 8 different mods; however it will expand to be much larger in the future.
